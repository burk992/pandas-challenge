# Explanation

This is the submitted assignment for Module 4 of the Data Analytics Boot Camp by Chris Burk.

# Code sourcing

As with previous assignments, Youtube videos and code examples on Github were a big help to get to at least a point at which the code was mostly finished. Elsewise, everything else was written by me with the help of many of our "Solved" exercises from class. 

# Final notes

This assignment's initial commit is being submitted for a partial grade as I experienced a hard drive failure two days before the initial due date, paired with a personal hardship. I plan to go back and rewrite my code to make it work and finish it in a later commit for a better grade.
